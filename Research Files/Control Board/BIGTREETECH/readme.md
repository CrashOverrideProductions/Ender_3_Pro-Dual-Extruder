BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V1.x and V2.x mainboards are ultra-quiet, low-power, high-quality 3D printing machine controller boards from BIQU.

The first BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V1.x 32-bit control boards with integrated TMC stepper-drivers was initially specially designed to be a drop-in replacement upgrade board for the Ender 3 printers by Creality, making replacing the original 8-bit mainboard/motherboard hardware used by the very popular Ender-3 3D-printer quick and easy for most users. Software updates has since release also added compatibility for other 3D-printers with a single Z-axis stepping-motor, including support for CR-10, CR-10 Mini, Ender 3 Pro from Creality.

BIGTREETECH SKR Mini E3 V2.x has added additional hardware improvements and enhancements on based on community feedback. Among other things, these improvements and enhancements with SKR Mini E3 V2.x include two Z-axis interface ports, and SKR Mini E3 V2.x is today, in addition to the 3D-printers already support by the V1.x boards, also compatible with CR-10S, CR-10 S4, CR-10 S5, Ender 5, Ender 5 Pro, and Ender 5 Plus from Creality.

Note: If your motherbord version is BTT SKR Mini E3 V1.x, please check the correct BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3 V1.x documents which are located respectivly in both the firmware directory and hardware directory with that version.

Note! After refreshing the new firmware, please always restore defaults first and then store settings, the new coordinates used for leveling will take effect, LCD option path: Configuration-> Restore defaults, Configuration-> Store settings.

Disclaimer! Marlin firmware needs to be configured aND CUSTOMIZED by the customer themselves, the reason for this is that BIQU / BIGTREETECH does not know the specific hardware configuration of each individual customer and can therefor not not support individual configuration of special firmware specific to each customer. BIQU customer service will however if contacted provide configuration suggestions if details on your specific hardware setup is described. Other than e-mailing to <support@bigtree-tech.com> it is recommended to also use the BigTreeTech Facebook group and BigTreeTech Subreddit (Reddit community) channels for support, as well as posting bug-reports and feature-request as "issues" on @bigtreetech GitHub repository for BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3:
